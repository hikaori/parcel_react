# parcel_react
this project is created with parcel and react.

there is a great comand to create a react app(`npx create-react-app my-app`more detail [here](https://ja.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html))ã€€. However in this project, I created a react project without using the command inorder to learn how to create a custom react project.
